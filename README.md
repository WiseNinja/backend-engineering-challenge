Hi.

These are my submitted backend challenge sources.
I have used Java and IntelliJ to write and compile it.

It uses 2 external libraries com.google.gson to parse JSON input and produce output and apache.commons.cli to parse input arguments.

You can compile the sources and run the application with the following arguments:
-input_file path_to_file
-window_size size of the calculatiion time frame

The output file is named analysis_results.json and it is generated in the same directory as the input file.

Please note that I am not a Java developer and my main language is C# so I had the extra challenge to figure out the "translation" between languages and also the code may not conform to some Java standard practices.
